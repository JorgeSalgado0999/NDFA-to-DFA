# This program will have the next functions:
# 1) Read a .txt file to create a NDFA and then give the equivalent DFA
# 2) from the same .txt file verify if the input is valid for that NDFA for this we have the next funtcions:
#   a) transition function -> return me where do i get from q0 with a for example
#   b) union -> return the union of two arrays WITHOUT duplicates
#   c) conversor function that makes all the process
